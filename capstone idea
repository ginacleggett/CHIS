 
For my Capstone project, I'm planning to look at datasets of the numbers of popular commercial fish caught over the last decade (by country) and compare the change in those numbers to the datasets of climate change (by country).

Looking for -
What is the correlation of climate change to quantity of catch?
Which fish are fairing better given the rising ocean levels and temperature change?
Are certain geographies seeing more extreme changes than others over time?
